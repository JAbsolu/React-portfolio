    engineer specializing in building responsive web applications. 
    Currently enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in computer 
    science at Central Connecticut State University, my journey 
    in front-end development began in 2018 when I successfully 
    launched an ecommerce website on Shopify. Since then, I have 
    honed my skills in building ecommerce sites on Shopify and 
    ventured into freelancing, helping individuals launch their 
    online stores. In 2020, I embarked on a learning path with 
    FreeCode Camp, where I acquired the knowledge to create basic web apps.`,
